# ggmotif: An R Package for the extraction and visualization of motifs from MEME software

MEME Suit is a most used tool to identify motifs within deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or protein sequences. However, the results generated by the MEME Suit are saved using file formats, *.xml* and *.txt,* that are difficult to read, visualize or integrate with other wide used phylogenetic tree packages such as *ggtree*. To overcome this problem, we developed the *ggmotif* R package that provides a set of easy-to-use functions that can be used to facilitate the extraction and visualization of motifs from the results files generated by the MEME Suit. *ggmotif* can extract the information of the location of motif(s) on the corresponding sequence(s) from the *.xml* format file and visualize it. Additionally, the data extracted by *ggmotif* can be easily integrated with the phylogenetic data generated by *ggtree*. On the other hand, *ggmotif* can get the sequence of each motif from the *.txt* format file and draw the sequence logo with the function *ggseqlogo* from *ggseqlogo* R package.
